## About Me

Hi, I'm Harsha -- currently a MSc Visual Computing student at Saarland University. I study systems and theory for developing compute and data efficient deep learning models.

Topics I am currently interested in [in no specific order]:

- **Systems-aware** efficient **training** [or fine-tuning] and **inference** techniques for deep learning models
- **Model Compression** methods (Sparsity, Pruning, Quantization, Knowledge Distillation): exploring their effectiveness and trade-offs
- Enhancing **communication efficiency** in distributed and federated learning settings
- Large-scale models (Transformers): unraveling the secrets of their success and the mysteries of over-parameterization
- The interplay between **interpretability**, **fairness**, **privacy**, and model compression/efficiency techniques

Please feel free to go through my [projects](/projects), [publications](/publications) and if you're interested in some music/book/movie recommendations check out [media](/media)!
